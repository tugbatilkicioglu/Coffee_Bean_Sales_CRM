# Conclusion
The Coffee Beans Sales dataset was curated for CRM analytics and underwent comprehensive analysis.
The conclusion drawn from the process revealed that the dataset's suitability for effective CRM analytics was limited.
The primary issue identified was the lack of significant variation within the frequency variable.
This limitation impeded the accurate execution of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation and classification methods.
Consequently, the distinct differentiation of customer segments proved challenging.
